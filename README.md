# Deep-learning-in-python-mnist-
This is a simple deep learning project in python using mnist datasets.

The MNIST datasets is a acronym that represents the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset
The datasets contains 60,000 small square 28x28 pixel grayscale handwritten images of single digits betwwen 0-9.

In this project, I will utilize the tensorflow and matlabplotlib library.
